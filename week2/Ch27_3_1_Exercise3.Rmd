```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```


It's interesting to see the different peaks of counts of diamonds based on carat. It is evident that there are more diamonds of lower carats around 1 carat or less. Most of the data is concentrated on the left side, as it is more rare to have diamonds of higher carat.
